            <h1>Why Decentralization Still Matters in 2026</h1>
            <div class="meta">January 29, 2026 · Wendy de Vries</div>
            
            <p>Every few years, someone declares crypto dead. The bubble burst, they say. The dream is over. And every few years, the builders quietly keep building while the speculators move on to the next shiny thing.</p>
            
            <p>I've been in this space since 2017, back when Swarm City was pioneering peer-to-peer marketplaces on Ethereum. I've seen the ICO mania, the DeFi summer, the NFT craze, and the inevitable corrections that followed each wave. Through it all, one thing hasn't changed: the core principles still matter.</p>
            
            <h2>It's not about the price</h2>
            
            <p>The easiest mistake is conflating cryptocurrency prices with the value of decentralization. When Bitcoin hits all-time highs, everyone's a believer. When it crashes, suddenly the whole thing was a scam.</p>
            
            <p>But decentralization was never about getting rich. It's about:</p>
            
            <ul>
                <li><strong>Censorship resistance</strong> — No single entity can shut you down</li>
                <li><strong>Permissionless access</strong> — Anyone can participate, regardless of geography or status</li>
                <li><strong>Trustless coordination</strong> — Strangers can transact without intermediaries</li>
                <li><strong>Ownership</strong> — You control your assets, your data, your identity</li>
            </ul>
            
            <p>These principles matter more in 2026 than they did in 2017. We've watched platforms deplatform users at will, banks freeze accounts without explanation, and governments weaponize the financial system. The need for alternatives isn't theoretical anymore.</p>
            
            <h2>What I learned from Swarm City</h2>
            
            <p>Swarm City taught me that the technology is the easy part. Building communities, changing behaviors, competing with convenient centralized alternatives — that's the hard part. We had beautiful tech and noble intentions, but user adoption is a different beast entirely.</p>
            
            <p>The projects that will win aren't necessarily the most decentralized. They're the ones that make decentralization invisible — that give users the benefits without requiring them to understand the underlying mechanics.</p>
            
            <h2>Still optimistic</h2>
            
            <p>I'm still here because I believe the trajectory is correct, even if the timeline is uncertain. Every generation gets a little more comfortable with digital ownership, a little more skeptical of centralized platforms, a little more aware of the trade-offs we make for convenience.</p>
            
            <p>The future isn't guaranteed to be decentralized. But I'd rather bet on a world where it is. 🔗</p>
