            <h1>A New Chapter</h1>
            <div class="meta">January 29, 2026 · Wendy de Vries</div>
            
            <p>After years of writing for Swarm City Times and contributing to various crypto publications, I finally have my own corner of the internet. No editors, no deadlines, just me and my thoughts.</p>
            
            <p>It feels strange, honestly. I've spent so long amplifying other people's visions — interviewing Bernd about Swarm City's origins, explaining token mechanics to newcomers, documenting the dreams of decentralization. But what about my own dreams?</p>
            
            <h2>What to expect</h2>
            
            <p>This blog won't have a strict focus. I'll write about technology when it excites me, travel when I feel like sharing, and life when it gets interesting. Maybe some thoughts on being a digital nomad in your mid-thirties, when everyone else seems to be settling down.</p>
            
            <p>I have a cat named Pixel and a tattoo of a dark angel. I work remotely, get paid in bitcoin, and I'm still figuring out what "home" means. If any of that resonates with you, stick around.</p>
            
            <h2>Why now?</h2>
            
            <p>2026 feels like a good year for new beginnings. The crypto winter taught us who was here for the tech and who was here for the money. The builders kept building. The believers kept believing. I'm still here, still curious, still optimistic about a more decentralized future.</p>
            
            <p>So here's to new chapters. Let's see where this goes. 🌍</p>
